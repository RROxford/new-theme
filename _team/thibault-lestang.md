Following a PhD in computational physics, Thibault joined the [Oxford Research Software Engineering](https://www.rse.ox.ac.uk/people/){:target="_blank"} group, driven by a strong belief that academia can vastly benefit from research software experts.
As a research software engineer, Thibault provides research software expertise across divisions, from morning code reviews to long term software development in collaboration with researchers.

He aims to raise the profile of research software and software development in the academic community. He is particularly interested in establishing code review as a standard practice in academia. Regular code reviews between researchers and RSEs can greatly impact the overall quality of research software, distribute software skills and experience, as well as encourage an open mindset in sharing development practices. To this end, in July 2019, Thibault started the [Oxford Code Review Network](https://ox.ukrn.org/events/#Oxford-Code-Review-Network){:target="_blank"}. This initiative aims at making code review easier for all researchers across the university.

Thibault is an advocate for free/libre and open source software in academia, and is involved in the setting up a [FLOSS network in Oxford](https://ox.ukrn.org/events/#Oxford-Free-Open-Source-Software){:target="_blank"}. Feel free to get in touch with him if interested!

Finally, in May 2021, Thibault became a [Software Sustanibility Institute Fellow](https://software.ac.uk/about/fellows/thibault-lestang){:target="_blank"}.
