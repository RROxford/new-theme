Following a PhD in computational physics, Thibault joined the [Oxford Research Software Engineering](https://www.rse.ox.ac.uk/people/) group, driven by a strong belief that academia can vastly benefit from research software experts.
As a research software engineer, Thibault provides research software expertise across divisions, from morning code reviews to long term software development in collaboration with researchers.
Thibault is an advocate for free/libre and open source software in academia, and is currently involved in setting up a FLOSS network in Oxford. Feel free to get in touch with him if interested!
