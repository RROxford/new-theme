Nilo researches Early Slavic syntax and semantics using quantitative and computational methods. He is working towards the expansion of historical digital treebanks of Slavic (the [TOROT Treebank](https://nestor.uit.no/)) and on the development of computational tools for historical text processing and analysis. He particularly values collaborative and multidisciplinary approaches, within and across the humanities, and considers open scholarship a prerequisite for innovative and inclusive research.
Since May 2020, he is also Editorial Assistant and Copyeditor for the [Journal of Open Humanities Data](https://openhumanitiesdata.metajnl.com/).
