Jonathan is an ancient historian, who read Classics at Oxford, and ancient history and archaeology at UCL, before teaching at Leicester and then returning to Oxford. Much of his work focuses on ancient Rome and Sicily, his research is increasingly concentrated on ancient inscriptions (the study of epigraphy), and the application of digital humanities methods to ancient history and epigraphy. He currently holds an ERC Advanced Grant (â€˜[Crossreads: Text, materiality, and multiculturalism at the crossroads of the ancient Mediterranean](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/885040)' which is devoted to the exploration of ancient Sicily through the application of digital methods to the surviving textual record. Particularly through his [I.Sicily project](http://sicily.classics.ox.ac.uk/inscriptions/), he is committed to championing the development of open data in ancient world studies.
