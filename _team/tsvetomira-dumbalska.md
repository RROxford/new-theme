Miraâ€™s DPhil research in the Perception and Human Information Processing Labs spans the intersection of psychology, neuroscience and economics. She is interested in how the context in which humans make a decision can sway their choice. Mira co-organizes the Decolonising Research Interest Group together with Olly Robertson, Mirela Zaneva and Manuel Spitschan.
