Matt studies advice-taking and decision-making with Nick Yeung and the [Attention and Cognitive Control](https://www.oxacclab.org/) lab, using a combination of behavioural experiments and computational models. He is interested in a broad range of Open Science topics, and helped compile the UKRN Primers on *Preprints* and *Data Sharing*.
