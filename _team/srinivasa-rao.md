Rao is a postdoctoral researcher interested in the molecular and genetic basis of cancer and metastasis. Having originally started his career as a medical doctor, he switched to full-time research soon after and currently split his time between the 'wet lab' and bioinformatics. His bioinformatics work involves analysing sequencing data for genomic and transcriptomic changes in prostate cancer. He uses software tools (R, Python, Snakemake) to make his research analyses reproducible and shareable, and he advocates their use through workshops and talks.
