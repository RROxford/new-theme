Chenzi's DPhil thesis examines the prosodic patterns of unstressed syllables in one of the regional Mandarin accents, ‘Plastic Mandarin’, in comparison to the standard Mandarin accent. Using quantitative modelling methods, it focuses on the characteristics of pitch variation and voice quality of unstressed syllables, and aims to capture any structured variation in pitch with regard to linguistic contexts, information structure, and social identity in our speech.
