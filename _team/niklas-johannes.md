Iâ€™m a Postdoc in the [Adolescent Well-Being in the Digital Age](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/research/projects/programme-on-adolescent-well-being-in-the-digital-age/){:target="_blank"} program at the Oxford Internet Institute. Under the supervision of [Andrew Przybylski](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/people/andrew-przybylski/){:target="_blank"}, I study the effects of technology use on well-being and performance.

My PhD had a similar topic: Here, I investigated effects of constant connectedness on performance and well-being. In my research, I follow Open Science practices. That means I preregister all studies and make materials, data, and analyses publicly available.
