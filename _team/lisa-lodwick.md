I am an archaeologist working on late prehistoric and Roman agricultural economies. My interests lie in the use of archaeological data sets (plant remains, stable isotopes, archaeological sites) to reconstruct past farming practices. I am editor-in-chief of an open access journal _Theoretical Roman Archaeology Journal_ published by the Open Library of Humanities, and work on improving data sharing and reuse practices in archaeology.
