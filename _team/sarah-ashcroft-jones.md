Sarah is studying mechanisms of decision-making and metacognitive confidence judgments with Nick Yeung in the Attention and Cognitive Control Lab. She uses computational models combined with behavioral experiments to understand the integration of uncertainty sources in the decision-making process. She holds a studentship from the Oxford-MRC Doctoral Training Partnership.
Sarah is an organizing member of ReproducibiliTea Oxford and is interested in advances and applications of a broad range of open science practices particularly among ECRs and students of psychology.
