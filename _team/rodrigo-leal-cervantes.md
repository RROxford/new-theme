Rodrigo is an applied Mathematician specialising in Networks Science. In his DPhil research, he tries to improve the modelling being done for network-like systems that are embedded in space, and for which distance shapes the connectivity that can be observed. In addition to this, he is interested in helping his colleagues learn about repoducibility in general, and good coding practices in particular.
