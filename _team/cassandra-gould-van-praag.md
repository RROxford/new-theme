The main focus of my role is to generate opportunities for the research community to actively participate in and contribute to the open science infrastructure of the Wellcome Centre for Integrative Neuroimaging (WIN) and Oxford Neuroscience by facilitating engagement with the [WIN Open Neuroimaging Project](https://www.win.ox.ac.uk/open-neuroimaging){:target="_blank"}. I also work between departments and alongside partners in other institutions to develop policies and recommendations for good governance around open science that work for individual facilities, across departmental boundaries within medical sciences, and then beyond into the wider University and national networks. Prior to this post, I provided magnetic resonance imaging support to the [Oxford BRC Experimental Medicine Theme and the Psychopharmacology and Emotion Research Laboratory](https://www.psych.ox.ac.uk/research/psychopharmacology-and-emotion-research-laboratory){:target="_blank"}. Here I lead efforts to improve the efficiency and reproducibility of image analysis and experimental data collection by teaching good practice in computer programming and data management. Prior to joining Oxford, I was a postdoctoral researcher and project manager with [Prof. Hugo Critchley at Brighton and Sussex Medical School](https://www.bsms.ac.uk/about/contact-us/staff/professor-hugo-d-critchley.aspx){:target="_blank"}, where I used MRI, experimental psychology and physiological monitoring to investigate the role of physiological arousal in cognitive and emotional processing, along with the impact of interoceptive abilities in modulating arousal-based processing in psychiatric disorders such as anxiety and schizophrenia. I completed my PhD in Informatics in 2013 under the supervision of [Prof. Anil Seth at the University of Sussex](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/sackler/people/directors){:target="_blank"}, where I investigated individual differences in synaesthesia using MRI and extensive exploration of the first person experience. I completed an MSc in Cognitive Neuropsychology under the supervision of [Prof. Geraint Rees at UCL](http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/~grees/){:target="_blank"}, and a BSc in Biological Sciences (genetics and immunology) from the University of Brighton.
