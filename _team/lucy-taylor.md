I am a Junior Research Fellow at Christ Church College based in the Oxford Tracking Group in the Department of Zoology, University of Oxford. I am also a Research Associate of Save the Elephants. My main research interests centre around movement ecology, animal behaviour and human-wildlife interactions, particularly of African savannah elephants.
