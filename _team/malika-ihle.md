Malika Ihle is the Reproducible Research Oxford Coordinator, supporting the Steering Group in developing a comprehensive approach
to open scholarship and reproducible research that extends across all disciplines, using both bottom-up and top-down strategies.

Malika holds a PhD in Behavioral Ecology from the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology. During her post-docs at
the University of Sheffield and University of Florida, she organised a symposium on open science at the International Society for Behavioral Ecology conference, and developed and taught a postgraduate course guiding students through the scientific pipeline, from preregistration to a
reproducible and open workflow.

Malika is an Executive Committee member and the chair of the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion committee of the Society for Open, Reliable, and Transparent Ecology and Evolutionary biology ([SORTEE](https://www.sortee.org/){:target="_blank"}) and she is the UK Reproducibility Network ([UKRN](https://www.ukrn.org/){:target="_blank"}) local network lead at the University of Oxford.
