Malika is the coordinator for the Oxford node of the UK Reproducibility Network. She was recently appointed by Reproducible Research Oxford to develop a comprehensive approach to open scholarship and reproducible research that extends across all disciplines and that uses both bottom-up and top-down strategies. As the first full time coordinator of the kind, her aim is to gather existing initiatives, foster new ones, establish training, and propose policies for consideration by the University of Oxford. She holds a Master degree in Biology from Université de Bourgogne and Université du Québec à Montréal, and a PhD in Behavioral ecology from Max Planck Institute for Ornithology. During her post-docs at the University of Sheffield and University of Florida, she has organised a post conference symposium on open science, published an invited idea in the journal of Behavioral ecology entitled ‘Striving for transparent and credible research: practical guidelines for behavioral ecologist’, and as developed and taught a graduate course guiding students through the scientific pipeline, from preregistration to reproducible and open workflow.
