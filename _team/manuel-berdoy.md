I am a zoologist, born in France, who has had the privilege to work with animals such as primates in Africa, reptiles in America and seals and penguins in Antarctica. I then moved up the alphabet by moving to Britain, eventually settling in Oxford where I worked with small mammals, the hardest of them all.

My interests, usually within an evolutionary framework, have ranged from animal social behaviour to parasite manipulation but, in the last 17 years, welfare (of animals), design (of experiments), reproducibility (of results) and education (in relevant fields of biomedical sciences).
