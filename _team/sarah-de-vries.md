She completed a BSc in Psychology and a MSc in Behavioural Science at Radboud University. She wrote her Bachelor's thesis on the relation between exposure to psychological adversity and deception detection ability. The topic of her Master's thesis was the effect of resource scarcity on prosocial behaviour in a trust game.

Sarah has a strong interest in open and reproducible research. As part of her PhD, she plans to conduct a meta-analysis to test the influence of publication bias in the literature on intergroup discrimination in prosocial behaviour. Additionally, she aims to write several chapters of her PhD as registered reports, and to write her DPhil using software such as R markdown to promote a reproducible workflow.
