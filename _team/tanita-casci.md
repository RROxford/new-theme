Tanita Casci is the Director of the Research Strategy & Policy Unit at Oxford.   

The purpose of the Unit is to engage with national and international research policy, and to work collaboratively to facilitate research and impact of exceptional quality within a stimulating and supportive research environment.

The Unit’s priorities for advancing research culture are to:
- ensure that research staff are supported in their career development,
- recognise varied contributions to research, both in terms of people and outputs, and
- support researchers to do reproducible and transparent research.

Until September 2021 Tanita was the Head of Research Policy at the University of Glasgow, where she was also the institutional co-lead for [research culture](https://www.gla.ac.uk/myglasgow/ris/researchculture/) and the co-lead of the [Lab for Academic Culture](https://www.gla.ac.uk/myglasgow/ris/researchculture/labforacademicculture/). Tanita has a research background in genetics and for 12 years was a commissioning editor in genetics and genomics for the Nature Publishing Group.
