Abhishek is a Research Software Engineer at the [Oxford RSE group](https://www.rse.ox.ac.uk){:target="_blank"}, where he works along with fellow RSEs and academics from the University of Oxford to create research software and raise awareness of research software best practices. He is interested in improving software sustainability, software development productivity and reproducibility of research software through training and outreach. Besides his research software work, he applies novel machine learning and network science techniques to problems in computational social science and political science.  

Prior to being an RSE, Abhishek was a Research Fellow in Artificial Intelligence at the Department of Politics and International Relations (DPIR) and obtained his DPhil in Computer Science, both at the University of Oxford. He is also currently an Associate Member at DPIR.  

As of May 2021, Abhishek is a [Software Sustainability Institute Fellow](https://software.ac.uk/about/fellows/abhishek-dasgupta){:target="_blank"}. As part of his fellowship, he will be exploring how programming tools make it easier to develop correct, well-tested software as well as improve the research software development experience.
