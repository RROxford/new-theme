Free(Libre) Open Source Software (OxFOSS) meetups are held regularly to discuss free software. [Subscribe to the OxFOSS mailing list](https://web.maillist.ox.ac.uk/ox/subscribe/foss){:target="_blank"} to stay informed!

This initiative aims to bring together people with an interest in software freedom and open source, particularly in an academic context. Meetings are a mix of informal discussion and invited talks.

During Michaelmas term, meetings will be held  every other Monday at 3PM UK time.

Details
- **Practical reasons for using free/open source software in academia**  
_19/10 3PM-4.30PM - Discussion_

Advocating for the use of free and open source software is often made difficult by the fact that proprietary alternatives are deemed more convenient: either because they come with a larger set of features, or because they are already well established in one's community.
In this first OxFOSS event we will discuss what the  practical reasons are for using FOSS, with a focus on academic
research and scholarship. Free software is in fact widely used by many researchers for specialized tasks: R, scipy/numpy, jupyter, LaTeX...
What are the reasons behind this popularity?
Can these extend to other free software projects competing with proprietary alternatives for more common office tasks?
What are examples of when, and why, you choose to use a free software tool instead of a non-free alternative?

- **Licensing research software: public domain? copyleft? permissive?**  
_02/11 3PM-4PM_

_Invited talk by
Rowan Wilson, Oxford IT Services Research Support team Leader, and
Andrew Katz, Managing Partner and Head of Tech and IP at Moorcrofts_

In many cases, licensing your research software is necessary for anyone to use, read, modify and/or redistribute it.
Licensing software as free/open source is often the preferred option for research project, so as to facilitate
knowledge transfer and collaboration.
But what type of license should you opt for? Copyleft? Permissive? Should you waive all rights and release your software in the public domain?
We discuss the choice of free software license and its relation to intellectual property,
with a focus on research software written at the University of Oxford.


- **What can we do as a local FOSS community to advocate locally for FOSS?**  
_16/11 3PM-4PM - Discussion_

OxFOSS aims to create and foster a friendly and inclusive community of people concerned with issues regarding
software freedom and open source.
A longer term objective of OxFOSS is to rely on this community to advocate for free software
in broader circles, for instance to academics who have not been exposed to these issues.

In this session, we reflect collectively on our options to move forward as a
community and advocate for the use of free software around us in Oxford.
Possible topics for discussion include
-- Possible events and topics aimed at academics that are not familiar with the issues of
free/open source software. What are your preferred way of introducing these issues?
-- Oxford is a large, somewhat peculiar University. Who to target? Individual research groups,
departments?
-- Oxford is not limited to the University.
Should we broaden the focus of OxFOSS outside of academia and be inclusive to the local
community? What would be a suitable course of action?
