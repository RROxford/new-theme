Ever wanted a fresh pair of eyes to look at your code, or to track down a bug?
Would you like to get feedback on your research software from fellow research programmers?
Want to get in touch with other research programmers at the University of Oxford?

The Oxford Code Review Network (OxCRN) aims to make it easy for researchers at all levels, from students to senior professors, to engage in regular code reviews, both as reviewers and reviewees.
Whatever your research field or favourite programming language, code reviews will make your research software better; not only free of bugs, but also more readable and maintainable, making your research more open and reproducible.
It's also a great opportunity to engage with colleagues from other departments and Divisions!

OxCRN is beginner friendly: you don't need to be a veteran programmer to review code, and a basic knowledge of the relevant programming language will do. Whatever your level of experience, reviewing code is perhaps the best way to sharpen and widen your software skills.
