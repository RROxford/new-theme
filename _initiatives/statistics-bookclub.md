Statistics book club is an enthusiastic discussion group focused on working through a book or course collaboratively to improve all participants' statistical knowledge and understanding.
The book club meets online on Thursdays from 12.00-13.00 GMT. The schedule is flexibly set as weekly/fortnightly depending on the flow and workload of the chosen book. Newcomers of all abilities are very welcome.

To join the meetings, vote on the next book, and participate in the discussions, head to the #statistical_rethinking_bookclub channel on the Reproducible Research Oxford Slack workspace. To join the RROx Slack workspace, [sign up to the RROx mailing list](https://web.maillist.ox.ac.uk/ox/subscribe/rroxford) and receive a Slack joining link in the confirmation email, or ask the [RROx coordinator](https://ox.ukrn.org/people/#MalikaIhle) for a new link!
