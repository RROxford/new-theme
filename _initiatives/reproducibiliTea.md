[**ReproducibiliTea**](https://reproducibilitea.org/) journal clubs are a grassroots initiative for researchers to discuss articles and ideas about improving their work through open research practices.

You can join either or both of the following groups which meet in alternated weeks, by subscribing to their mailing lists:
- [clinical-reproducibilitea](https://web.maillist.ox.ac.uk/ox/subscribe/clinical-reproducibilitea) is co-organised by a team of early career researchers from NDORMS, Primary Care, and Psychiatry. Main contact: [James Smith](https://ox.ukrn.org/people/#JamesSmith)
- [reproducibilitea](https://web.maillist.ox.ac.uk/ox/subscribe/reproducibilitea), the funder group, is based in Experimental Psychology. Main contact: [Matt Jaquiery](https://ox.ukrn.org/people/#MattJaquiery)

Both groups welcome researchers of all career stages and disciplines.
