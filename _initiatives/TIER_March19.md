Project TIER's Faculty Development Workshops are designed for college and university faculty who are interested in integrating principles of research transparency and reproducibility into courses on quantitative methods and/or the supervision of student research.

The workshops introduce participants to protocols for conducting and documenting empirical research that ensure the reproducibility of all computational results, and then present a range of pedagogical strategies and curricular resources for teaching these methods to students in a variety of educational settings.

The objective is to help instructors develop plans for teaching reproducible research practices that will be feasible and effective in their particular contexts, so that they are fully prepared to implement the methods presented at the workshops when they return to their home institutions.
