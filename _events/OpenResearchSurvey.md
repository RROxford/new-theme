This survey is aimed at academics, research staff and fellows, research support staff, and postgraduate research students, based in all academic Divisions of the University of Oxford (Humanities; Mathematical, Physical, and Life Sciences; Medical Sciences; Social Sciences; Gardens, Libraries and Museums; Continuing Education) and/or in the Colleges. The results of the survey will inform implementation of open research practices and responsible research assessment, and shape related training provision across the collegiate University.

Due to the pandemic, we will administer this survey in two rounds.
The first round, from January 2021 to 1st March 2021, is targetting **postgraduate research students** only.

You are warmly invited to share your views on open research in a survey developed by Reproducible Research Oxford. Professor Patrick Grant (Pro-Vice-Chancellor Research) commented: “The survey will help to inform our implementation of open research practices across the collegiate University, and to understand what postgraduate researchers want from open research. It is a chance for postgraduate students in all disciplines to shape how research could evolve and how the University could best support them in this transition”.

Your views would be very welcome whether or not you are aware of open research practices, and whether or not you deem them relevant or necessary for your field of research.

Participation in the survey is entirely voluntary and anonymous. As a ‘thank you’ for taking part, Reproducible Research Oxford will donate £1 to the [University’s Coronavirus Hardship Fund](https://www.development.ox.ac.uk/hardship) for each survey submitted (up to a total of £1,500), and you will have the option to enter a raffle for a chance to win one of **five £50 gift cards** from Blackwell’s.
The survey will remain open until 1st March 2021.
