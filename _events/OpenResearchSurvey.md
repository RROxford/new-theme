**Survey: [Open research at Oxford](https://oxfordxpsy.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bPkTO2fNbeDmDS5)**

Calling all Oxford researchers! You are warmly invited to share your views on open research in a survey developed by Reproducible Research Oxford. Professor Patrick Grant (Pro-Vice-Chancellor Research) commented: “This is an important and timely undertaking. The results of the survey will inform implementation of **open research practices** and **responsible research assessment**, and shape related **training provision** across the collegiate University”.

The survey is aimed at **academics**, **research staff** and **fellows**, **research support staff**, and **postgraduate research students**, based in **all academic Divisions** of the University (Humanities; Mathematical, Physical, and Life Sciences; Medical Sciences; Social Sciences; Gardens, Libraries and Museums; Continuing Education) and/or in the **Colleges**. You are encouraged to take part whether or not you are aware of open research practices, and whether or not you deem them relevant or necessary for your field of research.

Participation in the survey is entirely voluntary and anonymous. As a ‘thank you’ for taking part, Reproducible Research Oxford will donate £1 to the [University’s Coronavirus Hardship Fund](https://www.development.ox.ac.uk/hardship) for each survey submitted (up to a total of £1,500), and you will have the option to enter a raffle for a chance to win one of **five £50 gift cards** from Blackwell’s.
The survey will remain open until 1st March 2021.
