Have you heard of executable manuscripts or thesis? Are you starting using R markdown or LaTeX to combine text and statistical outputs? Are you still searching for the optimal way to compile reproducible documents ready for submission?   

This community call is primarily designed for researchers who have already attended beginner workshops (e.g. in R markdown or LaTeX) or started to teach themselves the tools needed to create executable/reproducible manuscripts but are still wondering how to combine it all, all the way to submitting a computationally reproducible manuscript.  

In this session, we will start with a brief introduction showcasing the benefits of executable research articles and the basic tools that allow us to create them. We will then watch short pre-recorded demonstrations of diverse workflows from RROx community members. They will share which software they use, what they are, and how they combine them into a reproducible pipeline to produce PDFs ready for submission. We will then invite attendees to discuss advantages and challenges of each workflow presented as well as share their own tips so we can collectively define a set of best practices when it comes to producing a manuscript. Finally, we will combine information and resources shared by attendees with the accompanying notes from the demonstrators to create a reference sheet for the RROx community. RROx will then strive to organise beginners and advanced workshops to teach the skills needed to implement the pipelines considered to be most efficient and reproducible. This session will not be recorded, but the prerecorded workflow demonstrations of the workflows will be made available on the OSF repository: https://osf.io/prbjm/
