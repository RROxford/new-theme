We are running an online Software Carpentry workshop from 7 Dec 13:30 to 9 Dec 13:30.
This 16 hours workshop will cover the **Unix shell**, version control in **git**, and programming in **Python**.
It is free and open to any member of the University â€“ researchers, staff, and students.

Software Carpentry aims to help researchers get their work done in less time and with less pain by teaching them basic research computing skills. This hands-on workshop will cover basic concepts and tools, including program design, version control, data management, and task automation. Participants will be encouraged to help one another and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems.
