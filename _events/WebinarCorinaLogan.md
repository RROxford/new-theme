**[Corina Logan](http://corinalogan.com){:target="_blank"}** from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, will be presenting the initiatives she leads and/or co leads to improve research rigor such as  [#BulliedIntoBadScience](http://bulliedintobadscience.org){:target="_blank"}, a campaign where early career researchers are working to change academic culture to adopt open research practices; and [Peer Community in Registered Reports](https://rr.peercommunityin.org/){:target="_blank"}, a free, supra-journal platform that reviews & recommends Registered Reports preprints across all research fields (see also this [Science news article](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/04/fifteen-journals-outsource-peer-review-decisions){:target="_blank"} publicising its launch)  

Webinar title: *How Peer Community in Registered Reports lets researchers take back control over the publishing process*

Abstract: *There is a desperate need to reform the production and dissemination of scholarly outputs to increase transparency, reproducibility, timeliness, academic rigor, and equity. I will discuss what researchers are doing to address these issues by sharing ways to tackle biases and facilitate higher quality research that puts researchers back in control using Peer Community in Registered Reports - a free, supra-journal platform that reviews and recommends registered reports across all research fields.*

We hope to have a vibrant discussion afterwards!

Date: **28 June 3pm BST**
