- [#BulliedIntoBadScience](http://bulliedintobadscience.org), a campaign where early career researchers are working to change academic culture to adopt open research practices  
- [Peer Community in Registered Reports](https://rr.peercommunityin.org/), a free, supra-journal platform that reviews & recommends Registered Reports preprints across all research fields (see also this [Science news article](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/04/fifteen-journals-outsource-peer-review-decisions) publicising its launch)
