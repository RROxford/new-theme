**[Corina Logan](http://corinalogan.com)** from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, will be presenting the initiatives she leads and/or co leads to improve research rigor such as  
- [#BulliedIntoBadResearch](http://bulliedintobadscience.org), a campaign where early career researchers are working to change academic culture to adopt open research practices  
- [Peer Community in Registered Report](https://rr.peercommunityin.org/), a free, supra-journal platform that reviews & recommends Registered Reports preprints across all research fields (see also this [Nature news article](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/04/fifteen-journals-outsource-peer-review-decisions) publicising its launch)

We hope to have a vibrant discussion afterwards!
