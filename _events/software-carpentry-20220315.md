We are running an online Software Carpentry workshop from 15 March 9:45 to 15 march 17:45.
This 16 hours workshop will cover the **Unix shell**, version control in **git**, and programming in **Python**.
It is free and open to any member of the University â€“ researchers, staff, and students.
On this occasion, students from the Faculty of Linguistics, Philology and Phonetics will be admitted preferentially.

Software Carpentry aims to help researchers get their work done in less time and with less pain by teaching them basic research computing skills. This hands-on workshop will cover basic concepts and tools, including program design, version control, data management, and task automation. Participants will be encouraged to help one another and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems.

See the [workshop website](https://chenchenzi.github.io/2022-03-14-ling/){:target="_blank"} for more details.

Instructors: [Chenzi Xu](https://ox.ukrn.org/people/#ChenziXu){:target="_blank"}, [Srinivasa Rao](https://ox.ukrn.org/people/#SrinivasaRao){:target="_blank"}, Winnie Smith.

Registration is mandatory, and participation requires setting up the software in advance by following the provided instructions (help desk sessions will also take place the week prior to the workshop).
