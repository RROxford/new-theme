In the coming months, we will run online study groups.

We continuously collate [online training resources](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bdkL8_3AFxU86IZt7Hz7OP2NE7SBWvRWwG3QMI4WVnI/edit#gid=0){:target="_blank"} (feel free to use, share, and populate), and people among us have volunteered to organise study groups around some of those resources.

**To join our community: please subscribe to our [RROx mailing list](https://web.maillist.ox.ac.uk/ox/subscribe/rroxford){:target="_blank"}**. In your welcome email, you will be invited to our Slack workspace and then you will be able to choose to join any of the public channels described below and to create new ones!
