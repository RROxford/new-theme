In the coming months, we will run virtual study groups.

We have collated some [online training resources](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bdkL8_3AFxU86IZt7Hz7OP2NE7SBWvRWwG3QMI4WVnI/edit#gid=0) (feel free to use, share, and populate), and people among us have volunteered to organise study groups around some of those resources.

**To join our community: please subscribe to our [RROx mailing list](https://web.maillist.ox.ac.uk/ox/subscribe/rroxford)**. In your welcome email, you will be invited to our Slack workspace and then you will be able to choose to join any of the public channels described below and to create new ones!


-	**ReproducibiliTea** organised by the Oxford Experimental Psychology team (welcoming everyone from Oxford and beyond!) is resuming  its journal club format and is available every week online! [Sign up to the reproducibilitea mailing list](https://web.maillist.ox.ac.uk/ox/subscribe/reproducibilitea) or visit the [ReproducibiliTea website](https://reproducibilitea.org/calendar). You can also continue the discussion over to the dedicated RROx Slack channel for ReproducibiliTea attendees.

-	**Oxford Free(Libre) Open Source Software (OxFOSS)** meetups is the result of a collaboration between researchers from RROx & Oxford Research Software Engineering ([OxRSE](https://www.rse.ox.ac.uk/)) interested in software freedom. OxFOSS will organise informal virtual meetups/lunches to discuss an article or a presentation about current free software practices in academia, tools, ethics, etc. If you are interested, please [subscribe to the OxFOSS mailing list](https://web.maillist.ox.ac.uk/ox/subscribe/foss/)!
