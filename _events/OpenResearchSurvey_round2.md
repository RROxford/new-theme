**Survey: [Open research at Oxford](https://oxfordxpsy.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_5tHA7oqau3ukeii){:target="_blank"}**

You are warmly invited to share your views on open research in a survey developed by Reproducible Research Oxford.

Professor Patrick Grant (Pro-Vice-Chancellor, Research) commented: *“Research methodologies, the expectations of funders, and the way research is disseminated are changing. This survey aims to reveal how the University can best support researchers to understand, engage with, and lead a shift to more open research. I know researchers receive many survey invitations, but I hope you might find time to respond and help shape the training provision and other support activities across the collegiate University”*

The survey is aimed at **academics**, **research staff and fellows**, **research support staff**, and **postgraduate research students**, based in all **academic Divisions** of the University (Humanities; Mathematical, Physical, and Life Sciences; Medical Sciences; Social Sciences; Gardens, Libraries and Museums; Continuing Education) and/or in the **Colleges**. You are encouraged to take part whether or not you are aware of open research practices, and whether or not you deem them relevant or necessary for your field of research.

Participation in the survey is entirely voluntary and anonymous. As a ‘thank you’ for taking part, Reproducible Research Oxford will donate £1 to the University’s Graduate Student Support Fund for each survey submitted (up to a total of £1,500), and you will have the option to enter a raffle for a chance to win one of five £50 gift cards from Bookshop.org.

The survey will remain open until 1 March 2022.
