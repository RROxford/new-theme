Are you using programming languages such as R or Python? Are you sometimes struggling to work on a project and get the same results from a different computer or when working with collaborators? Are you still searching for an optimal way to keep track of your computational environments and packages versions to make your computational environments reproducible?

In this session, we will start with a brief introduction showcasing the benefits of reproducible computational environments and the most commonly used environment manager tools. We will then watch short demonstrations of these different tools from RROx community members and guest, before we discuss pros and cons of each presented tool with all attendees.
