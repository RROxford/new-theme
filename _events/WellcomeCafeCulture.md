We would like to discuss with you our current research culture and ways to improve it!

We will be hosting a [Wellcome Trust Café Culture](https://wellcome.ac.uk/what-we-do/our-work/research-culture/hosting-your-cafe-culture-discussion?utm_campaign=1681515_Caf%C3%A9%20Culture%20confirmation&utm_source=email&dm_i=2PXJ,101GR,7EFN5J,3SPIT,1){:target="_blank"} in **St John’s College from 5pm to 6.30pm on the 5th of March** (room tbc).

Please sign up on this [eventbrite page](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/wellcome-trust-cafe-culture-tickets-96672505065){:target="_blank"}!

This will be an opportunity to talk about the challenges we face in research culture, reflect on what a better culture would look like, and, most importantly, propose solutions for how Wellcome and other parts of the system could change.

Wellcome’s previous survey and interviews with researchers revealed a lot about our working culture and the kinds of problems we face.
[Read the findings](https://wellcome.ac.uk/reports/what-researchers-think-about-research-culture){:target="_blank"}.
Now, we have the chance to play our part and propose solutions!

Before our discussion:
Take a particular issue of research culture that you think needs to improve, and think about ideas for how to achieve that. What could individual researchers, research leaders, institutions, funders, professional bodies or others do? How could  different kinds of individuals and organisations reward, require and support good practices and behaviours?

*Some of the topics involved will touch on deeply personal experiences and may be difficult to discuss. Everyone in the group should be considerate and respectful, and we hope you feel able to speak openly. You might also want to make yourself aware of appropriate sources of support available at your institution.*
