Sarah de Vries is a first-year PhD student at the University of Oxford. She is working on an interdisciplinary project led by Laura Fortunato (Evolutionary Anthropology) and Miles Hewstone (Experimental Psychology), funded by the Calleva Research Centre at Magdalen College. She studies how human groups shape social behaviour.

Sarah completed a BSc in Psychology and a MSc in Behavioural Science at Radboud University. She wrote her Bachelor's thesis on the relation between exposure to psychological adversity and deception detection ability. The topic of her Master's thesis was the effect of resource scarcity on prosocial behaviour in a trust game.

She has a strong interest in open and reproducible research. As part of her PhD, she plans to conduct a meta-analysis to test the influence of publication bias in the literature on intergroup discrimination in prosocial behaviour. Additionally, she aims to write several chapters of her PhD as registered reports, and to write her DPhil using software such as R markdown to promote a reproducible workflow.
