  <div class="centered">Reproducible Research Oxford is a project based at the University of
  Oxford. We are the local branch of the UK Reproducibility Network and
  aim to lay the groundwork for a culture of reproducibility and open
  research practices in Oxford. To that purpose, we organise events, and
  have set up a network of ambassadors who provide information and
  initiate conversation on these issues at their departments.</div>
