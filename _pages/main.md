**Welcome!**

Reproducible Research Oxford is a project based at the University of
Oxford. We are the local branch of the UK Reproducibility Network and
aim to lay the groundwork for a culture of reproducibility and open
research practices in Oxford. To that purpose, we organise events, and
have set up a network of ambassadors who provide information and
urge conversation on these issues at their departments.

If you are passionate about open and reproducible research, do
**[get involved](/new-theme/get-involved)** with the project!
