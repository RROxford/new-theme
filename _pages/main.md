  <p>Welcome to Reproducible Research Oxford (RROx for short,
  pronounced "rocks")!</p>

  <p>RROx is the local network of
  <a href="http://ukrn.org/">UKRN</a>, the UK Reproducibility Network,
  at the <a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/">University of Oxford</a>. We
  are a University-wide initiative focused on advancing the open
  research agenda at Oxford. The overarching goal is to promote a
  coordinated approach to open scholarship and research
  reproducibility that extends to all disciplines.</p>
  
  <p>Our <a href="{{ '/people' | relative_url }}">Steering Group</a>
  works with key stakeholders across the University towards this
  goal. We also coordinate several related <a href="{{ '/events' |
  relative_url }}">events and initiatives</a> throughout the year, and
  we maintain a list of relevant <a href="{{ '/resources' |
  relative_url }}">resources</a> at Oxford and beyond. Our activities
  are supported by an inter-divisional award from the University's <a
  href="
  https://researchsupport.admin.ox.ac.uk/funding/internal/jff">John
  Fell Fund</a>.</p>

  <p>If you are based in Oxford and are interested in open scholarship
  and research reproducibility, do <a href="{{ '/get-involved' |
  relative_url }}">get in touch</a>!</p>
