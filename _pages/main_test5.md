    excerpt: 'Reproducible Research Oxford is a project based at the
    [University of Oxford](https://ox.ac.uk). We are the local branch
    of the [UK Reproducibility Network](https://twitter.com/ukrepro)
    and aim to lay the groundwork for a culture of reproducible and
    open research practices at Oxford University. We do this by
    organising events, including a ReproducibiliTea reading group,
    weekly Open Science lectures, and software carpentry workshops.'
