We organise various events and workshops to train academics to use
reproducible and open research practices.

**ReproducibiliTea**

* Every Friday during Michaelmas Term 2018, ReproducibiliTea journal
clubs were held.

**Seminar on Reproducibility and Open Research**

* There were seminars on Reproducibility and Open Research on Wednesdays
during Trinity and Michaelmas Term 2018.

**Software and data carpentry workshops**

We've held software and data carpentry workshops in the past, in order
to train in the effective use of computational tools in research. This
was done in a partnership set up with [Software
Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org) and [Data
Carpentry](www.datacarpentry.org).
