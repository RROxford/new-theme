## Regular events

### Software and data carpentry workshops

We organise software and data carpentry workshops that train researchers in
the effective use of computational tools in research. The workshops are held
in a partnership set up with [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org)
and [Data Carpentry](https://www.datacarpentry.org). The next workshop will be
held in Hilary Term 2019!

### ReproducibiliTea journal clubs

Once a week during term time, researchers from various departments read a paper
related to reproducibility and get together for discussion, snacks, tea, and
open science! Find out more on the
[ReproducibiliTea twitter page](https://twitter.com/reproducibilit).
