Feel free to get in touch with the RROx Coordinator, [Malika Ihle]({{
site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/people/#MalikaIhle), if you have any
questions, or with ideas for relevant events or activities. And if you
coordinate a related initiative in Oxford, do let us know, as we may
be able to help!

Take a look at the [people]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/people/)
involved, to see if any of them are based in your unit --- you can
also browse by [affiliation]({{ "/all_affiliations" | relative_url }})
or by [group]({{ "/all_groups"
| relative_url }}).

Finally, stay up to date by checking our [events]({{ site.url }}{{
site.baseurl }}/events) page, following us on
[Twitter](http://twitter.com/RR_Oxford), and subscribing to our
[mailing
list](mailto:sympa@maillist.ox.ac.uk?subject=subscribe%20rroxford)!
