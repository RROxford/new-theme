Are you passionate about reproducibility and open research? There are
several ways in which you can get involved:

* Attend one of our [events](new-theme/events/).
* Find out who the current [ambassadors](new-theme/about/) in your department
are, and contact them on any questions related to robust research practices.
* Become an ambassador yourself - just
[send an email to us](mailto:ReproducibleResearchOxford@gmail.com) and we'll
make sure your name gets added on our [team page](/new-theme/about)!

For any other questions related to the project, contact us via
[email](mailto:ReproducibleResearchOxford@gmail.com) or
[Twitter](http://twitter.com/RR_Oxford).
