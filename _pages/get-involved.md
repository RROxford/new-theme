We would love for you to get involved in RROx! Have you already
attended one of our [events]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl
}}/events/)? If you are organising a related activity in Oxford, do
[email us](mailto:ReproducibleResearchOxford@gmail.com), as we may be
able to help.

Take a look at the [people]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/people/)
involved and get in touch if you have any questions or ideas for
events or initiatives. You can also browse people by [affiliation]({{
"/all_affiliations" | relative_url }}) or by [group]({{ "/all_groups"
| relative_url }}).

You can follow us on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/RR_Oxford) and
subscribe to our [mailing
list](mailto:sympa@maillist.ox.ac.uk?subject=subscribe%20rroxford) to
stay up to date!
