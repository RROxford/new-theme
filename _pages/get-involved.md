We'd love for you to get involved! Have you already attended one of our
[events]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/events/)?

Take a look at the [people involved]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/people/)
in the project and get in touch if you have any questions, or ideas for events.

Don't forget to follow us on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/RR_Oxford) to stay up
